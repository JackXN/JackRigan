              I am a front-end web developer & Designer born in TÃ¸nsberg Norway,
              currently residing in salt lake city Utah. My interest in web
              development sparked a few years ago shortly after my 18th
              birthday. I began self teaching HTML CSS and Javascript and after
              about 6 months of going through courses on Udemy and several other
              learning platforms. I fell in love with the code quickly and took
              it upon myself to enroll in a full stack development bootcamp.

              Shortly after graduating the bootcamp i joined a crypto startup as
              a full stack developer. I helped design and build discord bots,
              nft websites, and portal pages for the network. As well as working
              on the crypto project, decided to integrate what i was learning
              with this company and use it in my own projects
